As we know that in a mongodb collection, we store similar documents i.e object having same key value pair.
 So  before storing any document in a collection, we need to describe those fields which are been used in that collection.
 This process is called modelling.
 For one collection, a one file is made in the server, inside models folder
 Models folder contains all the models(for diff collection) which are to be used in db.
